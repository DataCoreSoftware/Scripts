# SANsymphony / Linux - iSCSI rescan
# Written by:  Gaetan MARAIS
# Email:       gaetan.marais@DataCore.com
#
# Pre-requisites : This script as been wrote for ProxMox/Debian but should work on any linux system
#                  This will require netstat tools to work.
# Script detail: This script will create a 1 minute task on crontab that will check connectity to FrontEnd portal and availability of it
#                based on registred targets in /etc/iscsi/send_targets folder
#                Additionally this script will 
#                   - log operations in journalctl.
#                   - disable the open-iscsi service that cause a very large delay during the reboot of the node
